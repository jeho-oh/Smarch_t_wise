This is the repository for SPLC 2019 challenge solution paper: "t-wise Coverage by Uniform Sampling"

Abstract:

A giganticconfiguration space has over a trillion (1012) configura-tions. Efficiently testing gigantic configuration spaces ofSoftwareProduct Lines(SPLs) requires a sampling algorithm that is bothscalable and provides goodt-wise coverage. The 2019 SPLC Sam-pling Challenge [15] provides real-world gigantic feature modelsand asks for at-wise sampling algorithm that can work for thosemodels.We evaluatet-wise coverage with one of the provided gigan-tic feature models using the Smarch algorithm [8] that uniformlysamples SPL configurations.  While uniform sampling alone is notenough to produce100%1-wise and 2-wise coverage, we use stan-dard probabilistic analysis to explain our experimental results andto conjecture how uniform sampling may enhance the scalabilityof existingt-wise sampling algorithms.
