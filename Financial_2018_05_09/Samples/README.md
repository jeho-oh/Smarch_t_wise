# Sample data from Smarch

Two separate experiments were done for evaulating sampling time and maximum memory usage, as measuring memory usage slowed down the sampling time. The data for each experiments are on "Time" and "Memory" folder.

Each folder has following contents:
* \*.log file: shows the results on time and memory usage which were printed on console.
* \*.samples file: contains the samples created from Smarch. Note that, a sample is represented as set of variable assignments, where the mapping between a variable number and feature name is shown on the dimacs file.
* folders: contains the samples with the format specified in the SPLC Challenge, where the folder name indicates the number of samples.
